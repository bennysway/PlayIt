    The app
  </h2>

    <p>
      PlayIt is a multi-platform music streamer, developed for Android, Apple and Windows devices. It combines the
      power of a device's built in music function with the media soure of YouTube.<br><br>
      What makes this app different from using Youtube is the ability to focus on playlists, details, and infomation about
      songs instead of the music video. One of the best feature is when you search. No matter what keywords you use, the results
      will always be music videos and songs
